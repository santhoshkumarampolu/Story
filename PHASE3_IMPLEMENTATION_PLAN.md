  - Toolbar buttons and controls
  - Tab navigation (Story, Scenes, Characters, etc.)
  - Save/Share/Download actions
  - Status indicators and progress messages
- **Story Editor Components:**

    "error": "Error occurred"
  }
}
```

<!-- ### **Priority 2: Landing Page Translation** üè†

The landing page contains marketing copy and feature descriptions.

#### **3.3 Landing Page Components to Translate:**

- **Hero Section** (`/src/app/page.tsx`)
  - Main headline and tagline
  - Call-to-action buttons
  - Value proposition text
- **Features Section:**

  - Legal text

#### **3.4 Landing Page Translation Keys Needed (~30-40 keys):**

```json
{
  "hero": {
    "title": "AI-Powered Story Studio",
    "subtitle": "Create compelling stories with AI assistance",
    "cta": "Start Writing"
  },
  "features": {
    "aiAssisted": "AI-Assisted Writing",
    "multiLanguage": "Multi-Language Support",
    "collaboration": "Real-time Collaboration"
  },
  "navigation": {
    "features": "Features",
    "pricing": "Pricing",
    "about": "About"
  }
}
``` -->

### **Priority 2: Advanced Features** üöÄ

#### **3.5 User Language Preference Persistence:**

- Store user language choice in localStorage/cookies
- Remember language preference across sessions
- Sync with user profile if logged in

#### **3.6 Enhanced Translation Loading:**

- Lazy loading of translation files
- Preloading based on user behavior
- Error handling for failed translation loads
- Caching optimizations

#### **3.7 Dynamic Content Translation:**

- Integrate with translation API for user-generated content
- Translate project titles and descriptions
- Support for mixed-language content

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 3A: Editor Interface (Week 1)**

1. **Day 1-2**: Analyze editor components and identify translation points
2. **Day 3-4**: Create editor translation files (English, Telugu, Hindi)
3. **Day 5-6**: Implement translation integration in editor components
4. **Day 7**: Test and validate editor translations

### **Phase 3B: Landing Page (Week 2)**

1. **Day 1-2**: Analyze landing page content and structure
2. **Day 3-4**: Create landing page translation files
3. **Day 5-6**: Implement translation integration in landing page
4. **Day 7**: Test and validate landing page translations

### **Phase 3C: Advanced Features (Week 3)**

1. **Day 1-2**: Implement language preference persistence
2. **Day 3-4**: Add enhanced translation loading features
3. **Day 5-6**: Integrate dynamic content translation API
4. **Day 7**: Final testing and optimization

## üìä Expected Translation Coverage

### **After Phase 3 Completion:**

- **Total Translation Files**: 5 namespaces √ó 3 languages = 15 files

  - `common.json` (35 keys)
  - `projects.json` (25-36 keys)
  - `dashboard.json` (11 keys)
  - `editor.json` (50-60 keys)
  - `landing.json` (30-40 keys)

- **Page Coverage**: 100% of core application
- **Component Coverage**: All major UI components

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### **Phase 3 Testing Plan:**

1. **Unit Testing**: Individual component translation verification
2. **Integration Testing**: Cross-component language switching
3. **Performance Testing**: Translation loading speed
4. **User Experience Testing**: Bilingual display validation
5. **Error Handling Testing**: Failed translation scenarios

### **Test Scenarios:**

- Switch languages in editor while working on project
- Navigate between pages with different language selected
- Test translation fallbacks when keys are missing

## ü§î Questions for Consideration

Before starting Phase 3 implementation:

1. **Editor Complexity**: The editor has 1,526 lines - should we break it into sub-phases?
2. **Translation Quality**: Do you want native speaker reviews for Telugu/Hindi?
3. **Dynamic Content**: Should we implement AI translation for user stories/projects?
4. **Additional Languages**: Any plans for other languages (Tamil, Bengali, etc.)?
5. **Performance Priority**: What's the acceptable translation loading time?
