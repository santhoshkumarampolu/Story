Based on the following story elements, create a comprehensive plot points breakdown that:

1. Identifies the major turning points in the story
2. Outlines the three-act structure (if applicable)
3. Highlights key dramatic moments and conflicts
4. Shows character development and arc progression
5. Maps the emotional journey of the protagonist
6. Identifies the climax and resolution points

Story Elements:
${context}

Please create a structured plot points breakdown that includes:

- **Opening/Setup**: How the story begins and the world is established
- **Inciting Incident**: The event that sets the story in motion
- **First Act Break**: The point where the protagonist commits to the journey
- **Rising Action**: Key complications and obstacles
- **Midpoint**: A major turning point that changes the direction
- **Second Act Break**: The lowest point or major setback
- **Climax**: The final confrontation or resolution of the main conflict
- **Resolution**: How the story concludes and loose ends are tied

Focus on making each plot point clear, dramatic, and essential to the story's progression.`;
